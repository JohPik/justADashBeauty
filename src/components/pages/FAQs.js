              What do you mean by Natural Products?
            </p>
            <p>
              All of our products are considered natural because they only
              contain <span className='hot-pink'>natural ingredients</span> and
              ingredients derived from nature with minimal processing. A natural
              Ingredient is one which comes direct from the source with only
              minimal, if any, physical changes incurred and does not contain
              any synthetic chemicals in its structure.

            <p>
              Examples of natural ingredients are plant oils, herbal
              extracts,and essential oils.

              Are your products Certified Organic?
            </p>
            <p>
              Our products are not certified organic however we do use many
              certified organic ingredients in our formulations. You can
              recognise these ingredients in the product ingredient lists as
              they are marked with an asterisk (*). Please note a certified
              organic ingredient must have documentation to support its status
              of completely natural ingredient, grown without the use of
              synthetic pesticides or fertilisers.

              Are your products vegan and cruelty free?
            </p>
            <p>
              They sure are. All our products do not contain any animal-derived
              ingredient such as beeswax, honey or lanolin and we have never
              (and never will) test our formulations on animals.

              Is your packaging environmental friendly?
            </p>
            <p>
              We take environmental issues very seriously and are committed to
              use recyclable packaging as much as possible, providing it does
              not compromise the stability and quality of our products. We try
              to keep our packaging minimal by not overpacking. We currently use
              recyclable plastic and glass and we encourage you to find an
              alternative use for the containers once they are empty or to put
              them in your council recycling bin.

              Where are your products manufactured?

              Queensland, Australia.
